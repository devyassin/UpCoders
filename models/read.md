# i should view the section 148 the 12 min so that i can use practical framework so i can decide if i choose embedding or referincing option

# for example i have table of users and table of reviews the relationship between user and reviews is one to many . i will choose to do parent referencing because one user can have a lot of reviews and also we gonna access the reviews alone alot

# Fiew to Fiew relationship with Embedding example restaurant(macdonald) and locatins each restaurant macdonalds gonna have some others restaurants in defferent locations and each location gonna have fiew other restaurants
